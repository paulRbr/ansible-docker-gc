Makefile for easier Ansible usage
------------------

I have written a small Makefile to make your future ansible runs easier. Don't hesitate to [check it out](https://github.com/paulRbr/ansible-makefile/blob/master/Makefile).

Copy it in your ansible configuration directory and start using it via `make help`.
